His research work in geometric graphs is centred around the theme of establishing graph theoretic and geometric properties of the underlying spatial configuration, and use them to design efficient algorithmic solutions. The graph theoretic properties of interests are connectivity, bi-connectivity, spanning properties, diameter, planarity, perfect and bottleneck matchings, Hamiltonian cycle, separators, independent sets, vertex and edge colourings. The geometric graphs of particular interest are spanners, unit-disk graphs, plane graphs, proximity graphs, Delaunay triangulations and its variants. In geometric location analysis, he studies various algorithm design questions related to finding the best location to place facilities. In geometric path problems, he looks at variants and applications of shortest path problems in two and three-dimensions. The above three areas are interrelated. Often a geometric problem is transformed into a graph problem, and by exploiting the geometric structure a faster algorithm for the graph problem is obtained. Geometric spanners are main ingredients used in designing efficient algorithms for geometric path problems. This, in turn, requires the construction of spanners having useful structural properties. Matching in geometric graphs helps in understanding and discovering combinatorial and geometric structures inherent in these graphs.

After six years she received a Bachelor of Math in Computer Science and Combinatorics and Optimization, and since the degree had so many words in it, decided to keep collecting them. Some years later she received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University with a thesis on incremental algorithms, advised by Dexter Kozen. Keeping the academic streak alive, Alexa moved on to Oberlin College in Ohio, this time as a professor of Computer Science. There she stayed until 2017, when she unexpectedly decided to try her hand at software engineering at Google in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This fun-but-less-fun-than-teaching detour lasted 3 years and now you can find Alexa at Carleton University. Alexa estimates she has run enough miles to circle the globe around the 28th parallel, and eaten enough candy to feed, but not nourish, a small nation."
