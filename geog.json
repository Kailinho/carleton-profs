            "Biography": [],
            "Chris Burn is the supervisor of Carleton’s Graduate Programs in Northern Studies. He held an NSERC Senior Northern Research Chair at the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies from 2002-12, throughout the program’s life. He came to Canada in 1981 as a Commonwealth Scholar, and completed both the M.A. (Geography, 1983) and Ph.D. (Geology, 1986) at Carleton. He then moved to U.B.C. as a Killam fellow, to study with J.Ross Mackay, the world authority in his field. In 1989 Chris was awarded an NSERC University Research Fellowship, which he brought back to Carleton in 1992. In January 2018, Chris was awarded a D.Sc. (Geography) by Durham University, after examination of his published research by an international panel. Most recently, Chris received the Polar Medal from Her Excellency Rt. Hon. Julie Payette, Governor General of Canada.": [],
            "Chris is committed to long-term field investigations of frozen ground. His research is focused on the relations between climate and permafrost. He has been particularly interested in determining the response of ground temperatures and the active layer to climate warming as observed in the western Arctic since 1970. His program involves partnerships with several northern agencies, particularly Yukon Parks, Parks Canada, the Village of Mayo, Yukon and Aurora Colleges, and the Departments of Transportation in Yukon and NWT. Dr Burn has been involved with the environmental and regulatory reviews of several northern projects, including the proposed Mackenzie Gas Project and the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway.": [],
            "His research program strives to provide explanations for the behaviour of permafrost terrain that are founded in field verification of physically based models. Projects completed at Herschel Island relate the present ground thermal regime to climate change over the past 120 years. Fieldwork there has also shown how temperatures inside an ice cellar at Pauline Cove allow comparison between convective and conductive heat transfer. Long-term observations at the Illisarvik drained lake field experiment build on Dr Mackay’s work, and have just given an uninterrupted 40-year record of active-layer development that may be the longest in North America. Ground temperatures collected at Illisarvik confirm the effect of regional warming in winter on summer thaw depth. In central and southern Yukon data collection is primarily concerned with the effect of changes in surface conditions on ground temperatures, especially following forest fire in Takhini River Valley, near Whitehorse, and after thaw slumping, near Mayo. Graduate student projects are woven into the general program that covers these themes.": [],
            "The work has primarily been supported by NSERC, PCSP, the Aurora Research Institute, and Transport Canada. Northern agencies also provide critical assistance, especially the Village of Mayo, Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk Territorial Park, and Tuktut Nogait National Park. Since 1992, 25 Master’s and five PhD theses have been completed in the program, with one Ph.D. thesis and one M.Sc. project underway. He has supervised eight Master students in the Northern Studies program.": [],
            "Chris has served as Chair of NSERC’s Committee 186 (Scholarships and Fellowships Committee for Ecology and Earth Sciences, 2010); as Chair of the Canadian Northern Studies Trust Northern Science Committee for adjudication of Weston Awards for Northern Research (2007-11); as Vice-President of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (2004-09); President of the Arctic Circle (2009-12); and Co-Chair of Transport Canada’s Network of Expertise in Northern Transportation Infrastructure Research (2011-14). He currently serves as co-chair of NSERC’s Committee 1506 (Discovery Grants for Geosciences) and is President of the International Permafrost Association.": [],
            " In 2012 Chris edited a 242-page, multidisciplinary account of the natural and cultural history of Herschel Island, Herschel Island Qikiqtaryuk. The book is a partnership with 12 supporting agencies, involving 43 authors, 24 of whom live north of 60°.  It is lavishly designed and carefully copy edited to be accessible to a broad audience, ranging from community members to graduate students beginning their program.": [],
            "Chris Burn is an internationally recognized expert in the domain of permafrost and ground ice in Yukon and the western Arctic. A professor of geography and environmental studies at Carleton University, he is equally adept at fostering meaningful and productive partnerships with relevant stakeholders in Canada’s North, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the effects of climate change on permafrost terrain and tundra ecosystems.                   Photo credit: Sgt Johanie Maheu, Rideau Hall Her Excellency presents the Polar Medal to Christopher Robert Burn.

            "Biography": [],
            "My research sits at a crossroads between geomatics, physical geography and big data science. I focus on ecosystem monitoring and extraction of biophysical parameters from remotely sensed imagery, but I also critically assess how bias and uncertainty can affect the use of these tools in a variety of landscapes.  By coupling remote sensing with extensive monitoring in the field, my research helps detangle hydrological, vegetation and climate interactions so that we can better predict the responses of wetlands and northern ecosystems to change.": [],
            "My work in ecosystem mapping began by researching the restoration potential of salt marshes that had been severely impacted by human alteration (dyking, ditching and conversion to agricultural land) in my home region of the Bay of Fundy. This research interest carried forward to my PhD research where I adapted machine learning methods for multi-sensor (polarimetric SAR, LiDAR and optical) imagery classification as well as modelling of soil moisture from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for the prediction of surface soil moisture spatially and temporally in peatlands. I have also accumulated a variety of experiences working in the federal government. Most recently I have been leading research for the integration of geomatics methods for estimating emissions for Canada’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and Air Pollutant Emissions Inventories at Environment and Climate Change Canada. I am excited about new cloud-based platforms that enable large area mapping and consistent temporal monitoring.": [],

Although this includes technical considerations related to data syntax, format and structure, we must also consider sharing across differences in world view, discipline, language, culture and other differences. Semantic interoperability, the ability to effectively share meaning across knowledge systems, is at the core of my research. These research themes are highly relevant to my focus on community-based research and consideration of the links between Western scientific and Indigenous Knowledge.  Since 2006 my work has focused on working with and addressing priority issues of Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic (i.e. Gwich’in, Yup’ik, Saami). This includes extensive experience working directly with Indigenous communities in a co-production model for the establishment of community-based expertise, capacity, and information infrastructure.": [],
            "I am Associate Director of the Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre (GCRC).  The GCRC focuses on the application of geographic information processing and management to the analysis of socioeconomic issues of interest to society at a variety of scales from the local to the international and the presentation of the results in new, innovative cartographic forms.  For almost two decades, I have been active in the coordination of international polar data activities and currently chair the Arctic Data Committee, and act as Technical Co-Lead of the Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability.": [],

I have focused on how these relationships manifest themselves in the unlikely sites of border security: in the interior of the United States and Canada, in cities, and in the everyday interactions between non-citizens, employers, municipal service providers, and local police. I am interested in how sovereignty, racialized identities, and citizenship are produced and transformed in these spaces. In the past, I have addressed these questions by exploring the history of “sanctuary cities” in the United States and Canada, as well as the passage of anti-immigrant ordinances by municipal governments.": [],

            "My research and teaching are informed by an interest in the ways in which states and communities interact in place. So for example, how are government policies and programs implemented or translated into everyday experiences; how do community members use, narrate and shape their environments; and in turn how do those actions and stories influence new government policies and programs. I focus this general interest through questions around citizenship and immigration, and environmental justice and urban health.These interests also reflect my interdisciplinary training centred around social planning and community development with stops in political science, biology and geography.The second half of my research and teaching focuses on research methodologies and methods thinking about the ways in which we can better address the questions above. In my own work I combine quantitative, qualitative and interpretive spatial methods with participant observation, visual (and sensory) studies, archival research, community design and participatory methods.All of my work is strongly informed by both feminist and critical perspectives, and so praxis – bringing together ideas, and action – and a focus on using methods and technology to promote increased social justice are also important links between all of my research.": [],

            "Professor Taylor’s main research interests lie in the application of geospatial information management to the analysis of key socio-economic problems in a national and international context and the presentation of the results in innovative new cartographic forms. His interests in cartography and international development issues are often inter-related. He has extensive field experience in developing nations, especially in Africa; this includes a six year period as an education officer in rural Kenya where he completed his Ph.D. thesis on Rural Development in Muranga District. His research interests in this area include: development studies with special reference to Africa, China and Latin America; regional and rural development theory and practice, sustainable development and Indigenous development strategies; technology transfer in the field of geomatics; Canada’s international policies in overseas development assistance; and technology transfer. Professor Taylor introduced and continues to develop the new paradigm of cybercartography. Current research is focussed on the use of cybercartography and the innovative NUNALIIT cybercartographic data management platform to produce a series of atlases on a wide variety of topics, especially in cooperation with Indigenous communities. This includes exploring a range of issues dealing with Traditional Knowledge, including legal and ethical considerations.": [

            "I am interested in how environmental change, particularly land-use and climate change are impacting freshwater ecosystems. My research focuses on three broad areas: 1) impacts of climate warming and nutrient enrichment on lakes and streams, 2) ecosystem resilience, regime shifts, and recovery in freshwater systems and 3) the importance of extreme events (e.g. droughts, storm surges, permafrost slumps) in altering aquatic ecosystems. Because changes to the environment often occur over large areas and at timescales of decades or longer our lab employs a variety of techniques including lake survey studies, paleolimnological techniques, and the analysis of long-term datasets to meet our research objectives.": [],

            "I studied urban planning and geography at the University of Toronto. After finishing my PhD, I had the good fortune to complete a postdoctoral fellowship at the wonderful Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (Azcapotzalco) in Mexico City. As an urban geographer, I’m broadly interested in housing, planning and urban governance issues and their relationship to precarity and equity. My research focuses on the geographies of “informal” housing and spatial regulation, everyday planning practices, space and gendered livelihoods, and the spatial politics of neighbourhood (barrio) upgrading in Mexico City. This research has explored access to land and housing issues as well as the ways that “formal” planning maps and programs intersect with planning practices to produce “informality” in different territories of the city. At Carleton, I’m cross-appointed to the Institute of Political Economy (IPE) and participate in the Latin American and Caribbean Studies (LACS) Program. I welcome graduate students with overlapping or related research interests. Some students may also be interested in our MA Geography with Specialization in Latin American and Caribbean Studies.": [],

            "About 20 years ago I became a cultural/ historical geographer after a career in archaeology. My research interests have focused on place, nation and identity. In particular, I am interested in how meaning is written in place and how meaning changes through the life-story of a particular place. I coined the term place-biography to describe this process. Within this framework my specific interest is in heritage places that help to inform and reinforce a sense of local, regional or national identity. Lately, I have taken an interest in post-industrial landscapes and in the recording, or recapturing, of cultural memories associated with them. This work I have been doing through collaborative class and individual projects with senior undergraduate students. The latest project has been the creation of an online Historical Atlas of the Changing Landscapes of Chaudiere Falls and the islands, Ottawa. A similar project will shortly focus on LeBreton Flats.": [],
