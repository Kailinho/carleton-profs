Working alongside a team of undergraduate, master’s and doctoral students, Dr. Barbeau is testing ways to use mechanical vibrations to send encoded messages between underwater nodes. His team has worked to find ways to deal with challenges like multipath propagation of underwater acoustic waves – when signals are received by more than one path – influenced by reflection at sea surface and seabed, and refraction due to factors like water temperature, depth and surface waves, among other. His team tested their prototype in Ottawa’s Rideau Canal."

Current Research,
,"Dr. Maheshwari works in the field of design, analysis, and implementation of sequential, parallel, and external memory algorithms for problems arising in Computational Geometry, Graph Theory, and Data Science. Recently, he has been looking into problems related to geometric graphs, geometric location analysis and shortest path problems. His research work in geometric graphs is centred around the theme of establishing graph theoretic and geometric properties of the underlying spatial configuration, and use them to design efficient algorithmic solutions. The graph theoretic properties of interests are connectivity, bi-connectivity, spanning properties, diameter, planarity, perfect and bottleneck matchings, Hamiltonian cycle, separators, independent sets, vertex and edge colourings. The geometric graphs of particular interest are spanners, unit-disk graphs, plane graphs, proximity graphs, Delaunay triangulations and its variants. In geometric location analysis, he studies various algorithm design questions related to finding the best location to place facilities. In geometric path problems, he looks at variants and applications of shortest path problems in two and three-dimensions. The above three areas are interrelated. Often a geometric problem is transformed into a graph problem, and by exploiting the geometric structure a faster algorithm for the graph problem is obtained. Geometric spanners are main ingredients used in designing efficient algorithms for geometric path problems. This, in turn, requires the construction of spanners having useful structural properties. Matching in geometric graphs helps in understanding and discovering combinatorial and geometric structures inherent in these graphs. In location analysis problems, the underlying geometric structure with graph-theoretic techniques is exploited to design faster algorithms."

,"Dr. Oommen has done research in the general areas of Artificial Intelligence for more than 40 years. In the fields of Stochastic Learning and Learning Automata (LA), he has pioneered the field of Discretized LA. Some of the fastest and most accurate LA are due to the work done by him and his co-authors. Research in these fields earned him his elevation to be a Fellow of the IEEE. In the area of Statistical Pattern Recognition (PR) he has pioneered the theory and applications of the so-called Anti-Bayesian paradigm of PR. Together with his co-authors, he also introduced the science and art of Chaotic PR. His work in using Dependence Trees to achieve PR is also well recorded. In the area of Syntactic PR, his award-winning algorithm has attained the optimal and information theoretic bound, and this earned him his elevation to be a Fellow of the IAPR. Within the field of Neural Networks (NNs), he has worked extensively with the Kohonen’s NN, and has demonstrated how one can merge the structure of the NN and its topology. Besides these, he has also worked in the general fields of AI, intelligent game playing, and LA-based data compression."

He received a Master of Science degree in 1979, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1982, both from Purdue University, Indiana, USA. In 2003, Dr. Oommen was nominated as a FELLOW of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) for research on subfields of artificial intelligence.

,"Alexa Sharp, born in Ottawa on August 30th, believed for many years that she was born on the 31st. After a childhood growing up in both Canada and Indonesia, Alexa chose to attend the University of Waterloo, where she was able to mix school and “real work” in their Co-op program. After six years she received a Bachelor of Math in Computer Science and Combinatorics and Optimization, and since the degree had so many words in it, decided to keep collecting them. Some years later she received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University with a thesis on incremental algorithms, advised by Dexter Kozen. Keeping the academic streak alive, Alexa moved on to Oberlin College in Ohio, this time as a professor of Computer Science. There she stayed until 2017, when she unexpectedly decided to try her hand at software engineering at Google in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This fun-but-less-fun-than-teaching detour lasted 3 years and now you can find Alexa at Carleton University.

Current Research,
,"Dr. Van Oorschot’s research is&nbsp;centred on&nbsp;authentication, Internet security infrastructure such as SSL/TLS and certificate-based architectures, software security, client device security, and usable security. His interest in Internet authentication includes methods to augment ordinary passwords with additional dimensions such as geolocation, device recognition, and other means with zero or minimal burden on users. This complements his interest in public-key infrastructure (PKI), text and image-based passwords, and more generally, identity management taking into account both human users and software design constraints. Other current research interests include smartphone security, secure software installation, network scanning, and the interconnected areas of software, application and web security."
Biography,
,"Dr. Van Oorschot is a Professor and Canada Research Chair in Authentication and Computer Security. He is also the co-author of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography. From 2008 to 2013 he was the Scientific Director of NSERC Internetworked Systems Security Network, a pan-Canadian strategic research network exploring computer and Internet security.&nbsp; Dr. Van Oorschot received both his Master’s and Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo, which also later awarded him the&nbsp; J.W. Graham Medal in Computing and Innovation in 2000.&nbsp;In 2011, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the oldest association of scientists and scholars in Canada. He joined the School of Computer Science at Carleton University in 2002."

Specific Research Interests,
,"Dr. Zhao’s primary research interests mainly concern low-level platform security, including but not limited to hardware, firmware, hypervisor and OS. Specifically, he would like to find out the actual trustworthiness of underlying components that are assumed or have to be trusted, and based on the findings what can be done to eventually achieve trustworthy program execution. He is also interested in solutions to authentication, privacy preservation and data protection that make use of the low-level approaches."

Current Research,
,"At the intersection of Data Management and Knowledge Representation, Dr. Bertossi’s research investigates uncertainty management in data and Knowledge. While inconsistency management in databases has been his main research area for years, Dr. Bertossi has more recently been investigating the notion and computation of causality within large data sets. Inconsistency and causality are two components of uncertainty. While solutions such as data cleaning aid in reducing uncertainty, the presence of big data makes dealing with uncertainty much more difficult and crucial. In lieu of this, Dr. Bertossi searches for ways to make use of inconsistent data in a semantically correct manner solving inconsistencies, when the data are used. With the reliance on big data across all industries from manufacturing to marketing analytics, developing models for dealing with uncertainty in the presence of bigger datasets will be of increasing importance."
Biography,
,"Dr. Bertossi received a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1988. He then joined their faculty as a professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science. He also served as President of the Chilean Computer Science Society in 1996 and again from 1999 to 2000.
