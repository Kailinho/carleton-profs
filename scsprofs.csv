Stack Overflow and npm), Empirical Software Engineering, Mining Software Repositories, and Software Ecosystems. In particular, I leverage historical project data and apply Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Statistical Analysis techniques in order to better understand what and how software practitioners use the crowd and build techniques to help them effectively take advantage of these crowd resources."

Specifically, he would like to find out the actual trustworthiness of underlying components that are assumed or have to be trusted, and based on the findings what can be done to eventually achieve trustworthy program execution. He is also interested in solutions to authentication, privacy preservation and data protection that make use of the low-level approaches."
